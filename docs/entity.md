## Entity

Entity is a data crate that, basically, contains data for one table row. Each entity has to implement `Nextras\Orm\Entity\IEntity` interface. Orm contains predefined `Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity` class; it implements the interface and provides other useful features.

Data is accessible through properties. You have to annotate all properties that should be available. Properties are defined by Phpdoc annotations. Let's start with a basic entity:

```php
use Nextras\Orm\Entity\PropertyWrapper\DateWrapper;

/**
 * @property int               $id {primary}
 * @property string            $name
 * @property DateTimeImmutable $bornOn {wrapper DateWrapper}
 * @property string|null       $web
 * @property AdminLevel        $adminLevel
 * @property-read int          $age
 */
class Member extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
}

enum AdminLevel: int {
    case Full = 1;
    case Moderator = 2;
}
```

Phpdoc property definition consists of its type and name. If you would like to use read-only property, define it with `@property-read` annotation; such annotation is useful to define properties that are virtual (calculated; e.g., based on values of other properties). Properties could be nullable; to do that, just provide another type - `|null` or prefix by question mark - `?string`.

If you put some value into the property, the value will be validated against the defined type. Type casting is performed if applicable and safe. Supported types are `null`, `string`, `int`, `float`, `array`, `mixed`, enum (int/string backed) and object types.

- Validation is provided on all properties, except for properties defined with a property wrapper - in that case validation is a responsibility of the property wrapper.
- PHP 8.1 enums are validated as expected; Enum's backed value is used for the storage layer;
- Array values are validated only to be an array, i.e., array shapes are not checked in the runtime (use PHPStan to check it during development);
- Simple object values are validated only to be an object, i.e., object shapes are not checked in the runtime (use PHPStan to check it during development);

Nextras Orm provides enhanced support for date-time and date handling via built-in property wrappers. However, the only "safe" `DateTimeImmutable` instances are supported as a property type. You may set a common `DateTime` instance as a value, but it will be automatically converted to `DateTimeImmutable`. Also, an automatic date-string conversion is supported. Date handling (without a time) is supported via built-in `Nextras\Orm\Entity\PropertyWrapper\DateWrapper` that has to be explicitly specified as a property wrapper (in the contrary to the DateTimeWrapper, that is implicit for DateTimeImmutable properties).

```php
use Nextras\Orm\Entity\PropertyWrapper\DateWrapper;

/**
 * @property int                    $id {primary}
 * @property DateTimeImmutable      $registeredAt (implicit DateTimeWrapper here)
 * @property DateTimeImmutable|null $bornOn {wrapper DateWrapper}
 */
class Member extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity {}
```

Property access is the easiest way to work with the data; this feature is not defined in `IEntity` interface, but is provided by abstract `Nextras\Orm\Entity\AbstractEntity` implementation. To use only the interface, call `getValue()` method for reading, `setValue()` method for writing, `hasValue()`, etc. There is a special `getRawValue()` method, which returns a raw representation of the value. The raw representation is basically the stored value (a primary key for relationship property).

```php
$member = new Member();

$member->name = 'Jon';
$member->setValue('name', 'Jon');
$member->born = 'now'; // will be automatically converted to DateTimeImmutable

echo $member->name;
echo $member->getValue('name');

echo isset($member->web) ? 'has web' : '-';
echo $member->hasValue('web') ? 'has web' : '-';

$member->isPersisted(); // false
```

Attaching entities to the repository lets Orm know about your entities. Attaching to a repository runs the optional dependencies injection into your entity (see later). If you need a dependency before attaching entity to the repository, you can pass the dependency via entity's constructor, which is by default available to be inherited.

Each entity can be created manually. Entities can be simply connected together. Let's see an example:

```php
$author = new Author();

$book = new Book();
$book->author = $author;
$book->tags->set([new Tag(), new Tag()]);
```

If an Author instance is attached to the repository, all other new connected entities are automatically attached to their repositories too. See more in [relationships chapter](relationships).

#### Getters and setters

Entity allows you to implement own getters and setters to modify the passed value. These methods are optional and should be defined as `protected`. The method name consists of the `getter` prefix, and a property name, `setter` prefix respectively. You can define just one of them. Getters and setters are not supported for property wrappers (e.g., that relationships cannot have them).

Getter method receives the stored value as the first parameter and returns the desired value. Setter method receives the user given value and returns the desired value for storing it in the entity. Getters of virtual properties do not receive any value (always receive a null value).

```php
/**
 * ...
 * @property string $name
 * @property int    $siblingsCount
 */
class FamilyMember extends Entity
{
	protected function getterName(string $name): string
	{
		return ucwords($name);
	}

	protected function setterSiblingsCount(int $siblings): int
	{
		return max((int) $siblings, 0);
	}
}
```

### Property modifiers

Each property can be annotated with a modifier. Modifiers are optional and provide a possibility to extend entity properties' behavior. Modifiers are written after the property name. Each modifier is surrounded by curly braces. The first compulsory token is the modifier name, other tokens are optional and depend on the specific modifier type. Orm comes with few predefined property modifiers:

- `{primary}`                                - makes the property mapped as a primary key;
- `{primary-proxy}`                          - makes the property a proxy to map the primary key; useful for composite primary key easy access;
- `{default now}`                            - defines a default value;
- `{virtual}`                                - marks property as "do not persist in storage";
- `{embeddable}`                             - encapsulates multiple properties into one wrapping object;
- `{wrapper PropertyWrapperClassName}`       - sets property wrapper;
- `{1:m TargetEntity::$property}`            - see [relationships](relationships).
- `{m:1 TargetEntity::$property}`            - see [relationships](relationships).
- `{m:m TargetEntity::$property}`            - see [relationships](relationships).
- `{1:1 TargetEntity::$property}`            - see [relationships](relationships).

#### `{primary}` and `{primary-proxy}`

Each entity has to have defined the `$id` property.
By default, the `$id` property is the only primary key of the entity; the `$id` property is defined in the base `Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity` class, but it is not marked as primary, because this is the default behavior, which can be changed by the `{primary}` modifier. By adding the modifier to property, you mark it as the new primary key. You can use the modifier multiple times to create a composite primary key. If the modifier is applied to a relationship property, the relationship's foreign key is automatically used.

```php
/**
 * @property int    $id       {primary}
 * @property string $name
 */
class Tag extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
}

/**
 * @property array{Tag, User} $id       {primary-proxy}
 * @property Tag              $tag      {m:1 Tag::$followers} {primary}
 * @property User             $follower {m:1 User::$followedTags} {primary}
 */
class TagFollower extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
}


$tag = new Tag();
$tag->id = 1;

$user = new User();
$user->id = 2345;

$tagFollower = new TagFollower();
$tagFollower->tag = $tag;
$tagFollower->user = $user;

return $tagFollower->id;
// returns array(1, 2345);
```

#### `{default}`

You can easily set the default value. The default modifier also accepts a reference to constant.

```php
/**
 * ...
 * @property string  $name   {default "Jon Snow"}
 * @property int     $type   {default self::TYPE_PUBLIC}
 */
class Event extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
	const TYPE_PUBLIC = 0;
}
```

#### `{virtual}`

Virtual modifier marks specific property as virtual - such property won't be stored in the mapper; this modifier is useful to use with `property-read` annotation together.

```php
/**
 * ...
 * @property      DateTimeImmutable $born
 * @property-read int               $age {virtual}
 */
class Member extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
	protected function getterAge(): int
	{
		return date('Y') - $this->born->format('Y');
	}
}

$member = new Member();
$member->born = new DateTimeImmutable('2000-01-01');
echo $member->age;
```

#### `{embeddable}`

Encapsulates multiple properties into a wrapper container. Read more in [Embeddables tutorial](embeddables).

```php
/**
 * @property-read int     $cents
 * @property-read string  $currency
 */
class Money extends Embeddable
{
}

/**
 * ...
 * @property Money|null $price {embeddable}
 */
class Product extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
}
```

#### `{wrapper}` -- property wrappers

Property wrapper encapsulates a property value. There are few basic types of property wrappers:

- **IProperty** - a basic wrapper that implements `Nextras\Orm\Entity\IProperty` interface; reading  property retrieves the wrapper object, writing into the wrapper is forbidden.
 *This wrapper is used in "has many" relationships. Reading the property value returns a wrapper object that holds the relationship.*

- **IPropertyContainer** - fully encapsulates its value; setting a value to the property proxies the value into the wrapper by calling `setInjectedValue()` method; reading value from the property is proxied to `getInjectedValue()` wrapper's method.
 *This feature is used in "has one" relationships. The property value goes through wrapper, user receives/sets the property wrapper inner state.*

Property wrappers are created by entity and lazily.

```php
/**
 * ...
 * @property \stdClass $json {wrapper JsonWrapper}
 */
class Data extends Entity
{
}

class JsonWrapper extends ImmutableValuePropertyWrapper
{
	public function convertToRawValue($value)
	{
		return json_encode($value);
	}

	public function convertFromRawValue($value)
	{
		return json_decode($value);
	}
}
```

### Entity dependencies

Your entity can require some dependency to work. Orm comes with `Nextras\Orm\Repository\IDependencyProvider` interface, which takes care about injecting necessary dependencies. If you use `OrmExtension` for `Nette\DI`, it will automatically call standard DI injections (injection methods and `@inject` annotation). Dependencies are injected when an entity is attached to the repository.

```php
/**
 * ...
 */
class Book extends Nextras\Orm\Entity\Entity
{
	/** @var EanSevice */
	private $eanService;

	public function injectEanService(EanService $service)
	{
		$this->eanService = $service;
	}
}
```
